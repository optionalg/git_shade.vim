Colours lines in different intensities according to their age in git's history
Also displays commit info for the current line in the cmdline.

Run `:GitShade` to shade the file, and again to turn it off.

Naturally this only works in Vim's GUI mode.
If you never have GUI mode available, you may want to try the
GitGutter plugin instead: https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter

Some possible options (see the plugin file for more):

    let g:GitShade_ColorGradient = "black_to_blue"
    let g:GitShade_ColorWhat = "bg"

    let g:GitShade_ColorGradient = "green_to_white"
    let g:GitShade_ColorWhat = "fg"

In the screenshots below, the brighter blue background indicates a more recent addition.

With `let g:GitShade_Linear = 0` the recent additions stand out clearly:

With `let g:GitShade_Linear = 1` we can see the relative ages of all lines in the file:
